Python String

1.  STRING:--

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

  eg:-
        print("Hello world")
        print('hello world')

in python quotes can use inside the quotes and you can use quotes inside function and String
  
  eg:-
        print("he is called 'john'")

Assign String to a Variable :-

    Assign a string to a variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
         
    eg:-
            a="Hello"
            print("a")


string and arrays :-
  Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
    
        a="Hello"
        print(a[2])

Looping Through a String :-

Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.

        for x in "apple":
            print(x)

String Length:-

To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

    a="the best thing in the life"
        print(len(a))


....





2.SLICING String:--

you can return a range of the characters by using the slice index

slicing start from the index and end of the index
1.slice from the start [:5]
2.slice to the end [2:]
3.Negative indexing[:-4],[-5:],[-5:-1]


....

3. MODIFY STRING:-

i. Upper case:
                This method returns the string in upper case:
                using this command upper().
                
ii. Lower case:
                This method returns the string in lower case:
                using this command lower().

iii. Remove whitespace:
                This method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:
                using strip().

iv. Replace string:
                This method replaces a string with another string:
                using replace().

v. split string:
                This method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:
                using split().

......

4. STRING CONCATENATION:--

        To combine two strings you can use the + operator.

.......

5. FORMAT STRING:...

    In python we can not combine the string and numbers 
     But using python format string we can combain the string and number
          for example :
            age = 23
            txt = f"my name is john , i am {age}"
            print(txt)

......

6. Python - Escape Characters:--

  To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
  An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
