Python Operators:--
        operators are used to perform operators on variables and values.
            Operators are:-
                1.Arithmetic operators
                2.Assignment operators
                3.Comparison operators
                4.Logical operators
                5.Identity operators
                6.Membership operators
                7.Bitwise operators
        
1.Python Arithmetic operators:--
    Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
        1.Addition(+)
        2.Subtraction(-)
        3.Multiplication(*)
        4.Division(/)
        5.Modulus(%)
        6.Exponentiation(**)
        7.Floor division(//)

2.Python Assignment operators:--
    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
        1.Simple Assignment(=)
        2.Add and Assign(+=)
        3.Subtract and Assign(-=)
        4.Multiply and Assign(*=)
        5.Divide and Assign(/=)
        6.Modulo and Assign(%=)
        7.Bitwise AND and Assign(&=)
        8.Bitwise OR and Assign(|=)
        9.Bitwise XOR and Assign(^=)
        10.Left Shift and Assign(<<=)
        11.Right Shift and Assign(>>=)
        12.exponentiation (**=)

3.Python Comparison operators:--
    Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
        1.Equal(==)
        2.Not equal(!=)		
        3.Greater than(>)		
        4.Less than(<)
        5.Greater than or equal to(>=)		
        6.Less than or equal to(<=)

4.Python Logical operators:--
    Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
        1.and
        2.or
        3.not

5.Python Identity Operators:--
    Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
        1.is ... x is y
        2.is not ... x is not y
6.Python Membership Operators:--
    Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
        1.in ... x in y
        2.not in ... x not in y
        
7.Python Bitwise Operators:--
    Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
        1.AND(&)
        2.OR(|)
        3.XOR(^)
        4.NOT(~)
        5.Zero fill left side(<<)... push left side zero into right side.
        6.signed right shift(>>)...  push right side zero into left side.
